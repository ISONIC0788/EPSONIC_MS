$balance = 1000; // initial balance
$bet = 100; // initial bet

while ($balance > 0) {
  echo "Your balance is: " . $balance . "<br>";
  echo "Your bet is: " . $bet . "<br>";

  } else {
    echo "You lost the bet!<br>";
    $balance -= $bet; // subtract the bet amount from your balance

//In this game, the player starts with a balance of 1000 and places a bet of 100. The game continues until the player's balance reaches 0. Each round, a random number between 1 and 10 is generated. If the number is greater than 5, the player wins the bet and their balance is increased by the bet amount. If the number is less than or equal to 5, the player loses the bet and their balance is decreased by the bet amount. The bet amount is increased by 10% for the next round.
